    <div class="intro">
      Step quietly into the heart of Kowloon, where history lingers in the brickwork and neon, and every alley has a secret. As dusk falls, the city’s familiar bustle gives way to whispers—echoes of vanished footsteps, flickers of forgotten lanterns, and tales that refuse to fade.<br><br>
      Tonight, you’ll trace a path through haunted churches, spectral markets, and storied temples. Some say the shadows here are deeper, the air colder, and the stories… not quite finished.<br><br>
      Are you ready to walk where the living and the restless meet? The tour begins when the city’s lights flicker—and not all who listen to the tales will be seen.
